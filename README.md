Program Name: Caesar Cipher Program
Description:
This program is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. It can be used for both encryption and decryption of messages.
Features:
Encryption and Decryption: The program can encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Shift Value: The program allows the user to specify the shift value, which determines the number of positions each letter in the plaintext is shifted.
Input Validation: The program includes input validation to ensure that the user selects a valid option and enters a valid shift value.
